/**
 * @typedef {object} ScoringItems
 *
 * `scoringItemToId` and `scoringIdToItem` map between numerical ids and human-readable attribute
 * names. While some attributes are straight-forward (yards, attempts, completions, etc.), some
 * attributes are niche items such as ranges.
 *
 * Scoring items that are not configured or enabled in a league's settings may still be populated on
 * API responses.
 *
 * There are several scoring categories scoring all have "per increment" scoring, i.e. points for
 * every <X> yards gained. The typically scoring pattern is something like 0.1 point per 1 yard. The
 * <X> point per 1 yard attribute does not include the "Per1Yard" suffix; only attributes like
 * "Per5Yards" have the matching suffix. "Per5Yards" scoring means that 5 total yards gained is
 * given 1 point, 9 total yards gained would be given 1 point, and 10 total yards gained given 2
 * points.
 *
 * Passing scoring items are typically only present for QBs, but position players (like RBs, WRs,
 * TEs) will occasionally make a passing play as well.
 *
 * Defensive yards allowed and points allowed are inclusive and only scored when their condition
 * is met. For example, if a DST allowed 360 yards, then `defensive350To399YardsAllowed` will be
 * scored (value is 1 when statistical) and the other defensive yard stats will not be populated.
 *
 * @property {number} passingAttempts Total passing attempts.
 * @property {number} passingYards Total passing yards.
 * @property {number} passingCompletions Total passing completions.
